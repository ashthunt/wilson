# Wilson

Using a Wilson score confidence interval to better sort a list of items by calculating its lower bound, given Bernoulli Parameters.

This NPM package was inspired by [Evan Miller's popular blog post](https://evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) on better implementations for star ratings on popular sites.

To better understand this idea, I used research from several other resources, including

- [Reddit blog (Randall from XKCD)](https://redditblog.com/2009/10/15/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system/)
- [Binomial Proportion Confidnece Intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval), Wikipedia
